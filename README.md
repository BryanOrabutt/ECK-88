# ECK-88

This project is an attempt to recreate the Intel ECK-88 development kit using KiCAD software to recreate the board and schematics. There are new additions, such as a pushbutton
to single step the clock for demo purposes, and LEDs triggered by each of the address and data lines.

## Modification

If you wish to make any modifications to the current board, all of the files are designed in KiCAD. The KiCAD software can be obtained here: http://kicad-pcb.org/. All of the
custom symbols and footprints are found in the Libraries and Libraries.pretty folders and will need to be manually added to the KiCAD library search path. The board was
designed to meet the requirements of OSH Park's fabrication rules. For more information see: http://docs.oshpark.com/design-tools/kicad/
